## Gene-Expression-Analysis
Exploring gene expression data to discover hidden patterns and relationships within complex datasets.

# Project Description
Gene expression analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding the molecular mechanisms behind various biological processes and diseases. This project dives into gene expression data analysis, aiming to extract meaningful insights from large and complex datasets.

# Objectives
Dimensionality Reduction: We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the high-dimensional gene expression data, making it more manageable and interpretable.
Biological Insights: By visualizing the PCA results and conducting statistical tests, we aim to identify gene clusters and associations indicative of specific biological pathways or disease mechanisms.
Data Visualization: Utilizing Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, we create informative visualizations to present our findings effectively.
